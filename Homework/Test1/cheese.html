            is a type of dairy product produced in a range of flavors, textures,
            and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It is composed
            of proteins and fat from milk, usually of cows, goats or sheep, and
            sometimes of water buffalo. During production, milk is usually
            acidified and either the enzymes of rennet or bacterial enzymes with
            similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate. The
            solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into
            finished cheese. Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind, the
            outer layer, or throughout.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over a thousand types of cheese exist, produced in various
            countries. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin
            of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been
            pasteurised, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the
            processing, and how long they have been aged. Herbs, spices, or wood
            smoke may be used as flavoring agents. Other added ingredients may
            include black pepper, garlic, chives or cranberries. A cheesemonger,
            or specialist seller of cheeses, may have expertise with selecting,
            purchasing, receiving, storing and ripening cheeses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most cheeses are acidified by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into
            lactic acid; the addition of rennet completes the curdling.
            Vegetarian varieties of rennet are available; most are produced
            through fermentation by the fungus Mucor miehei, but others have
            been extracted from Cynara thistles. For a few cheeses, the milk is
            curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cheese is valued for its portability, long shelf life, and high
            content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus. Cheese is more
            compact and has a longer shelf life than milk. Hard cheeses, such as
            Parmesan, last longer than soft cheeses, such as Brie or goat's milk
            cheese. The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when
            encased in a protective rind, allows producers to sell when markets
            are favourable. Vacuum packaging of block-shaped cheeses and
            gas-flushing of plastic bags with mixtures of carbon dioxide and
            nitrogen are used for storage and mass distribution of cheeses in
            the 21st century, compared with the paper and twine that was used in
            the 20th and 19th century.

        <h2>Processing</h2>
        <p>
          Processing A required step in cheesemaking is to separate the milk
          into solid curds and liquid whey. Usually this is done by acidifying
          (souring) the milk and adding rennet. The acidification can be
          accomplished directly by the addition of an acid, such as vinegar, in
          a few cases (paneer, queso fresco). More commonly starter bacteria are
          employed instead which convert milk sugars into lactic acid. The same
          bacteria (and the enzymes they produce) also play a large role in the
          eventual flavor of aged cheeses. Most cheeses are made with starter
          bacteria from the Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, or Streptococcus genera.

          <p>
            Other techniques influence a cheese's texture and flavor. Some
            examples are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Stretching (Mozzarella, Provolone)</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The curd is stretched and kneaded in hot water.</li>
                <li>This develops a stringy, fibrous body.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Cheddaring (Cheddar, other English cheeses)</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The cut curd is repeatedly piled up, pushing more moisture
                  away.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The curd is also mixed (or milled) for a long time, taking the
                  sharp edges off the cut pieces.
                </li>
                <li>This process influences the final product's texture.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Washing (Edam, Gouda, Colby)</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The curd is washed in warm water.</li>
                <li>
                  This lowers its acidity and makes for a milder-tasting cheese.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
